Title: Realistic Noise Simulation of Rigetti's QPU in PyQuil

Description: This proposal aims to introduce a new feature to PyQuil, specifically a realistic noise simulation of Rigetti's QPU. This feature will enhance the current PyQuil simulator's capabilities by providing a more accurate representation of quantum computation in the presence of noise.

Problem: Quantum computers are sensitive to noise from various sources, such as gate and measurement errors, decoherence, and environmental factors. Accurate simulation of these effects is crucial for researchers and developers to better understand their impact on quantum algorithms and design error-correcting techniques. While PyQuil already provides a noise simulation framework, the current implementation lacks the ability to simulate realistic noise in Rigetti's QPU, which limits its usefulness for those working with this specific platform.

Current Implementation: PyQuil's noise simulation framework includes support for basic noise models, such as depolarizing noise, bit flip, phase flip, and amplitude damping channels. However, these models may not fully capture the intricacies of noise in Rigetti's QPU, leading to a less accurate representation of how quantum algorithms will perform on the actual hardware.

Proposed Solution
We propose to enhance the noise simulation of Rigetti's QPU in PyQuil by incorporating the following features:

Calibrations (Class): Introduce a dedicated class to handle the most recent calibration data from Rigetti's QPU, such as gate fidelities, readout error rates, and qubit coherence times. This class will enable the creation of realistic noise models based on actual hardware specifications.

Single qubit noise - amplitude damping and dephasing: Improve the single-qubit noise simulation by including both amplitude damping and dephasing channels, which will provide a more accurate representation of the types of noise experienced by qubits in a real QPU.

Depolarizing channel: Include the depolarizing channel in the noise model, which represents a common type of noise in quantum gates and is essential for accurate simulation of quantum computation.

Readout noise: Add support for simulating readout noise, which is a significant source of error in quantum computation, especially when dealing with measurements.

Custom Intensity parameter: Allow users to customize the intensity of the noise model parameters, such as gate error rates, qubit coherence times, and readout error rates, enabling them to simulate different levels of noise or the effects of ongoing hardware improvements.

Support for non-native gates: Extend the noise simulation framework to support non-native gates, which are important for users who want to test custom gate sets or investigate the impact of gate decomposition on their algorithms.

We have considered alternative solutions, such as using existing noise simulation libraries like Qiskit's noise module, but believe that a tailored solution for Rigetti's QPU within PyQuil would provide the most accurate and seamless experience for users working with this specific platform.

By implementing these features, we aim to provide a more accurate and useful tool for researchers and developers working with Rigetti's QPU, allowing them to simulate quantum algorithms with realistic noise and develop error-correcting techniques tailored to this platform. This will ultimately help improve the overall performance and reliability of quantum computing applications on Rigetti's hardware.

# Integration

the code in new_noise.py sould be copied into noise.py so that those fetures could be used throug it.
it does not replace it as a new module.
