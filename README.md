V - insert fidelity, add pragma if gate isn't found

V - Investigate Riggeti's implementation KrausModel NoiseModel

conditional delay in decoherence_only_on_targets

V - one parameter to control noise intensity

presentation

How ti implement:

Operations needed for noise simulation in random order:

1. find all gates that need to be added
2. add headers to define the new gates
3. add the new gates to the program
4. define the new gates matrix's

Flow of adding noise to a program:

1.  find all gates that need to be added
2.  define the new gates matrix's
3.  add headers to define the new gates
4.  add the new gates to the program
