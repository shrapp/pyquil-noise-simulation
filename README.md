# To Emanuelle


# To Rigetti

Does gates hapeen in parallel?

sometimes

How much time each gate takes?

40/180

# To us

Insert calibration into noise function

Implement everything from scratch

Build new implementation for:
1. apply_noise_model
2. _decoherence_noise_model

without get_noisy_gate
